/* Test the word count program to uncover bugs.
For me the example of the word count program doesn't work.
The file is mentiones as 'word_counting.c'
Will try to solve it again later.
And follow up with this exercise.
I guess this won't be a program but rather a testing sequence. 

1. Any special character tests such which are not \t, \b and \n such as .,;:'"-
2. But there could proper nouns which could include ' and -
2. (1) can be solved but (2) is very contextual and I am unsure how that can be solved with my current skill set
