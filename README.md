# C-Programs
Practice programming in C

Contains rudimentary programs mentioned in "C Programming Language" 2nd ed. by K&R
Also my attempts to solve the 97 exercises in the book. They are actually tough/
Some programs from "C Programming: A Modern Approach" 2nd ed. by KNK is also included.
I am also trying to solve KNK also.

In my opinion KNK is the best book for a beginner.

I am self-taught so excuse the elegance of the programs.

Thank you.
