# C-Programs
Practice programming in C

Contains rudimentary programs mentioned in "C Programming Language" 2nd ed. by K&R
Also my attempts to solve the 97 exercises in the book.
Some programs from C Programming: A modern approach 2nd ed. by KNK is also included.

I am self-taught so excuse the elegance of the programs.

Thank you.
